  Description:"A three-day workshop was organized on 2nd, 3rd and 4th of February, 2020 by the Electronics and Communication Engineering Society (ECESOC), Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. There was a turnout of 30-40 students from first year to final year. Participants undertook exceptional interest in the workshop. Detailed explanation of MOSFETs, its analysis and related circuit design was delivered. The workshop successfully taught valuable topics and helped the students to perceive knowledge in various topics. Many doubts from students where then cleared regarding the topics and even about the future approach regarding advancements in it. This workshop had evolved the plan of our preparation and had amplified our knowledge immensely. The entire go through from basics to advance for the preparation for core companies was given. Guidance to all those who want to pursue higher studies or GATE was given.",

  Description:"In this, they presented every trace of telling about the route of electronics that ECE students would negotiate within upcoming semesters. In this workshop, seniors guided us to prefer the right route so that this quagmire of learning electronics feels like a cakewalk for us with a little planning and guidance. They provided us with every particular detail about how to accomplish this challenging journey in an interesting and fun approach. Starting from the first, they presented the opportunities on where to go, like - Campus placement, Off-Campus, M. S, M. Tech/PSUs, and MBA. They showed a list of companies which visited the campus to recruit graduates in ECE/EEE Core, likeâ€“Synopsys, Cypress, Tata Steel, etc. They did a concise description of each of the companies in the above list including the job summary, their eligibility criteria, placement processes, and compensation details. The seniors shared tips and experiences. They presented us the ECESOC Alumni Placement Record of k15 and k16 batch, which was motivating and informational. They conducted a doubt session so they could clear our confusions. This workshop had evolved the plan of our preparation and had amplified our knowledge immensely.",

  Description:"A two-days workshop was organized on 10th and 11th of October, 2019 by the Electronics and Communication Engineering Society (ECESOC), Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. The objective of the workshop was to give an overview of the basics of subject electronics, the use of technology in our day-to-day lives and make the fresh batch comfortable with the subject. The strength of attendees turned out to be huge. The session was interactive, students came up with doubts and satisfactorily cleared all of them. The passionate crowd enthralled the volunteers to give as much knowledge as possible. The workshop pumped up with the discussion on semiconductors then, their types(N-Type and P-Type),P-N Junction, rectifiers, clippers-clampers, BJT,FET, MOSFET, etc. The volunteers being seniors, gave some tips to tackle the problems regarding the subject , books and sites for reference to the fresh batch. Some practical electronic projects were displayed and their workings were shown to show the applications of the topics taught. Students were awestruck to encounter the working models and the Arduino project outshone all of the other projects.The top three students who came out with flying colors were awarded with certificates.",

  Description:"A two-days workshop was organized on 29th and 30th of September, 2018 by the Electronics and Communication Engineering Society (ECESOC), Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. The objective of the workshop was to explain how Digital Electronics can be utilised in microprocessor design. The session was interactive, students came up with doubts and satisfactorily cleared all of them at the moment. The passionate attendees enthralled the volunteers to give as much knowledge and information as possible. The workshop involved Comparison of analog and digital electronics, logic functions and truth table, logic gates, basic theorem properties, Boolean Functions, minterm-maxterm, k-map, adder, subtractor, decoder, encoder, mux, demux, flip-flops, etc. The volunteers being seniors, gave some tips to tackle the problems regarding the subject , books and sites for reference. Some practical electronic projects were displayed and their workings were shown to show the applications of the topics taught and hands on hardware projects were provided.Students were awestruck to encounter the working models and the Arduino project outshone all of the other projects. The workshop was concluded with certificate of participation given to the attendees to boost their confidence.",
