      description: "Bit Mesra (ECE), was not a smooth journey for me. I had an interest in electronics from 1st year only but as an average student, I found lot of difficulties. I did my best and with all my hard work, I started feeling comfortable and finally fell in love with Electronics. After 2nd year I got a chance to be a part of ECESOC, it helped me a lot in building my personality and the guidance from seniors helped me to evolve in my career. It has been a journey worth all my efforts. Currently, I am an Analog and mixed-signal design Engineer at Synopsys. I love my work because I always wanted to be here.My only suggestion for juniors to dream big because its only thing which gives life its purpose and direction. I personally believe in one thing that a hard worker can achieve anything if they have a strong dedication towards their work.",

College life indeed is the best phase of anyone’s life, a wild mish-mash of experiences, with all sort of hilarious stuff going down in the hostels and campus. My 4 years in E.C.E was full of excitement and fun whether it be sitting through boring lectures , passing engineering papers to finding the papers I really had interest in. It was in my 4th semester that I realized I wanted to pursue electronics as my main and since then It had been a journey worth all my efforts. Yes, it feels good to be in the industry I wanted to work for. Currently I am an ASIC Engineer in CPU team at Nvidia. To all the people out there the only suggestion I would give is find what interests you and then pursue it with all your dedication,enjoying your journey along the way. Finding what interests you is the tough part , once that is done then it’s all adherence and patience game for you. For any specifics you can always contact me. So pursue what you like and I bet, when you think of it all at end , it will bring nothing but smiles on your faces. Keep learning!!",
